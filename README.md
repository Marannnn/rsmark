# rsmark - CPU, RAM and DISK benchmark

## CPU

This benchmark is done by math operations- specifically multiplication of matrices. [Here is an example of matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).

The matrices are 2d arrays (an array containing other arrays, in this case these arrays are representing lines.)

## RAM
